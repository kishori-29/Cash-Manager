# Cash-Manager
                                                Simple Cash register made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


    I have created this mini project using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this you have to enter bill amount and cash, then we will tell that you have sufficint cash or not.
 If yes then we will find minimun number of notes(change) required.
